# Why GitHub Workflows? 🚀

<div class="text-lg mb-8">

**GitHub Workflows** are the **foundation** of agentic development - they enable
agents to independently react to code changes and execute actions.

</div>

## The Problem Without Automation

- **Manual code reviews** take hours to days
- **Testing** is forgotten or delayed
- **Deployment** is error-prone and inconsistent
- **Issue management** consumes developer time
- **Quality gates** are bypassed under time pressure

# Manual vs. Automated Workflows 🆚

::left::

## 👨‍💻 Manual Process

```
Developer creates PR
↓
Manual code review request
↓
Wait for reviewer availability
↓
Review feedback loop
↓
Manual testing
↓
Manual merge
↓
Manual deployment
↓
Manual issue closure

⏱️ Time: 2-5 days
🐛 Error Rate: 15-25%
```

::right::

## 🤖 Automated Workflow

```
Developer creates PR
↓ (instant)
Automated tests run
↓ (2-5 minutes)
AI code review
↓ (30 seconds)
Quality checks pass
↓ (instant)
Auto-merge if approved
↓ (instant)
Auto-deployment
↓ (5-10 minutes)
Auto-issue management

⏱️ Time: 15-30 minutes
🐛 Error Rate: 2-5%
```

# GitHub Actions: The Nervous System for Agents 🧠

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## Event-Driven Architecture

- **Push Events**: Code changes trigger workflows
- **PR Events**: Reviews and checks automated
- **Issue Events**: Ticket management automation
- **Schedule Events**: Proactive maintenance
- **Workflow Events**: Agent-to-Agent communication

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]
  issues:
    types: [opened, labeled]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'
```

</div>
<div>

## Agent Integration Points

- **Webhooks**: Real-time event notifications
- **API Access**: Full GitHub API integration
- **Secrets Management**: Secure credential handling
- **Artifact Storage**: Build outputs and reports
- **Environment Management**: Staged deployments

<strong>Key Insight:</strong> GitHub Actions = Agent Operating System

# ROI of Workflow Automation 💰

::left::

## Cost Calculation

```typescript
// Manual Process Costs
const manualProcess = {
  codeReview: 2, // hours per PR
  testing: 1.5, // hours per feature
  deployment: 1, // hours per release
  bugFixes: 4, // hours per production bug

  // Per month (team of 5)
  totalHours: (2 + 1.5 + 1 + 4) * 20 * 5, // 850h
  hourlyCost: 50, // €50/hour
  monthlyCost: 42500, // €42,500
};

// Automated Process
const automatedProcess = {
  setupTime: 40, // one-time setup hours
  maintenanceTime: 8, // hours per month
  toolCosts: 200, // GitHub Pro + tools

  monthlyCost: 8 * 50 + 200, // €600
  savings: 41900, // €41,900/month
};
```

::right::

## Break-even Analysis

- **Setup Investment**: 40h × €50 = €2,000
- **Monthly Savings**: €41,900
- **Break-even**: 1.4 days! 🚀
- **Annual ROI**: **25,000%**

# The Path to Agentic Development 🛣️

## Evolution Stages

<div class="space-y-4">

**🟢 Level 1: Basic Automation** (CI/CD, Testing)  
→ Reduces manual tasks by 50%

**🟡 Level 2: Intelligent Workflows** (AI Reviews, Smart Deployments)  
→ Automates decisions, 70% fewer interventions

**🟠 Level 3: Agent Integration** (Claude Actions, Auto-fixes)  
→ Agents execute complex tasks, 85% automation

**🔴 Level 4: Autonomous Teams** (Multi-agent Collaboration)  
→ Full autonomous development pipeline, 95% automation

</div>

<div class="text-center mt-6 p-4 bg-blue-100 rounded-lg">
<strong>Workshop Goal:</strong> Level 1 → Level 3 in 5 tasks
